## **What Sabitrade**

**Sabitrade is a smart trading intelligence and execution platform for Solana meme traders.**

It is built to solve **one core problem** most meme traders have:

> “I’m trading blind, late, emotional, and I keep buying noise instead of real money flow.”

Sabitrade **shows you where real money is moving, why it’s moving, and helps you trade it with discipline** — not vibes, Telegram hype, or random calls.

It’s not a broker.

It’s not just a chart.

It’s not just copy-trading.

It’s a **decision + execution system**.

## **The Problems Sabitrade Solves for Traders**

### **1. Traders Buy Late**

Most traders:

- See tokens **after** 5–10x
- Enter when smart wallets are already exiting
- Become exit liquidity

**SabiTrade fixes this by tracking smart wallet behavior early**, before hype spreads.

**2. Traders Follow Noise, Not Data**

Telegram calls, Twitter shills, and Discord signals:

- No accountability
- No wallet proof
- No context

**Sabitrade shows real on-chain actions**:

- Who bought
- How much
- At what stage
- With what history

No vibes. Only transactions.

**3. Traders Are Emotional**

Most losses come from:

- FOMO entries
- Panic sells
- Holding rugs too long
- No stop loss discipline

**Sabitrade enforces discipline through strategy configs**

So your system trades **for you**, not your emotions.

### **4. Traders Don’t Know Who to Follow**

Not all whales are smart.

Not all volume is real.

**Sabitrade identifies “smart wallets”**, not just big wallets:

- Consistent winners
- Good timing
- Clean exits
- Low rug exposure

## **What Sabitrade Actually Does (Core Features)**

### **1. Smart Wallet Intelligence (The Core Engine)**

Sabitrade continuously analyzes **on-chain Solana data** to identify wallets that:

- Buy early
- Sell intelligently
- Avoid rugs
- Show repeatable behavior

Each smart wallet has:

- Win rate
- PnL history
- Trading style (scalp, swing, momentum)
- Average hold time
- Risk profile

As a trader, you don’t guess **who is smart** — Sabitrade tells you.

### **2. Smart Wallet Buy/Sell Feed (Live Money Flow)**

Instead of charts first, you see:

- **Who is buying**
- **Who is selling**
- **How confident is the move is**

Each event shows:

- Wallet quality
- Token age
- Market cap
- Liquidity
- Risk flags (mint auth, renounced, LP state)
- Reasoning (“early accumulation”, “momentum buy”, “distribution sell”)

You trade **money flow**, not candles.

**3. Alpha Calls (Curated On-Chain Signals)**

Alpha calls are **filtered opportunities**, not spam.

They are generated when:

- Multiple smart wallets align
- Volume confirms the move
- Risk conditions are acceptable
- Entry timing is still early

Each Alpha Call answers:

- Why this token?
- Why now?
- What’s the risk?
- What’s the strategy?

This removes guesswork.

### **4. Trending & Momentum Detection**

Trending is not “most mentioned”.

It’s **on-chain momentum**.

Sabitrade tracks:

- Accelerating buys
- Wallet clustering
- Liquidity growth
- Sustained volume (not wash trading)

You see tokens **before** they explode, not after.

### **5. Strategy Config (This Is the Discipline Layer)**

This is where Sabitrade becomes powerful.

Instead of manually reacting, you set rules like:

- Buy only when ≥ X smart wallets buy
- Ignore tokens below Y liquidity
- Auto stop-loss at −Z%
- Take profit at A%, B%, C%
- Max hold time
- Re-entry rules
- Risk per trade

Once set:

**Your strategy executes consistently**, even when you’re emotional, asleep, or distracted.

### **6. Copy Trading (Smart, Not Blind)**

You don’t copy random wallets.

You copy **profiles**.

You can:

- Copy a conservative wallet
- Copy a fast scalper
- Copy early accumulators
- Copy only buys, not sells
- Apply your own stop-loss & TP

You stay in control while benefiting from smarter traders.

**7. Buy / Sell Execution (One Flow)**

From signal → execution:

- No switching apps
- No copy-pasting contracts
- No late entries

You see a signal → you buy → your strategy manages the rest.
